# TDS-Sensor
**The TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) Sensor**, also known as an Analog Electrical Conductivity (EC) Sensor, is used to measure the concentration of dissolved substances in water, such as minerals, salts, and ions. It works by measuring the water’s electrical conductivity — the higher the conductivity, the greater the total dissolved solids.

This sensor outputs an analog voltage signal proportional to the TDS level, which can be read and interpreted by a microcontroller. It is commonly used in applications related to water quality monitoring, hydroponics, aquariums, and environmental research.

## This sensor is suitable for:
- Drinking water quality testing
- Monitoring water in aquariums, agricultural fields, or natural water sources

**Cautions**
- Avoid modifying wires or connecting them incorrectly, as this may damage the device.
- Do not touch the sensor head while it is operating, as it may affect detection accuracy.
- If the sensor does not work, check the voltage and wiring connections.
